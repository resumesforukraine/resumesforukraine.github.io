<p>Guide</p>

<ul>
	<li>Resume is a strictly one-page document (written in English!). One page can fit in a lot. If something does not fit, you can discard older experience. Resume is not meant to be an exhaustive description of your professional experience - but rather a specific review of your key experiences, skills, and competencies.</li>
<br/>
	<li>By its nature, a resume is a somewhat dry document. The best thing to do when writing it is to follow a template (several templates are provided below). These templates have been polished over the years by university career officers to layout information in a way that is most convenient for hiring managers.</li>
<br/>
	<li>The overall structure is: (1) First and last name (in this order) + contact info (email, phone, address (home or office), LinkedIn/GitHub/personal website, as appropriate); (2) Work experience; (3) Education (education can go before work experience for people at the start of their careers and for academics); (4) Additional information (languages, skills, hobbies/interests - for personal touch).</li>
<br/>
	<li>Things to avoid: (1) photos (unless required); (2) brief bios/summaries at the top of the resume (the current view is that these should be avoided as they might hurt more than help and also waste valuable space in the resume).</li>
<br/>
	<li>The only case when the second page in a resume may be permissible is if there is a list of publications or a long portfolio of projects that is highly relevant to the job you seek. In that case, the second page can contain that list (but nothing else).</li>
<br/>
	<li><b>Exceptions:</b> The above rules apply to most professions. However, there are two exceptions.</li>
	<br/>

	 <li> First, professional academics, especially when looking for academic jobs, may use a different document called curriculum vitae or CV. This document is a multi-page, very detailed description of the past academic career with very different guidelines - it is not relevant to most job seekers though (see examples <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~amir1/PS/F/to_filippo/Donoho-resume.pdf">here</a> (statistics professor) and <a href="https://www.fondazionetorinomusei.it/sites/default/files/CV%20Christov-Bakargiev_01FEB2016.pdf">here</a> (art curator)). Academics looking for industry jobs would benefit from summarizing their experience and using the one-page resume for the job search.</li> 
	 <br/>
	<li>Second, for people of artistic professions, it is permissible to use a less strict format that captures their visual/artistic identity. The best advice here is to look at the top people in your field in the West and see how they summarize their job experience. However, the one-page resume is still a decent fallback option if you are unsure.</li>
